# TestingR
Scripts from online tutorials, course at UNIL and other sources I gathered in the process of learning R

I have taken a course at UNIL about a year ago, so I know the basics. I need to brush up on it and get into the nitty-gritties of R. Currently I am taking 2 courses - On Udacity by Facebook, and on Coursera by John Hopkins Univ. I'm waiting for the Analytics Edge to start in a month.
