Atomic classes: numeric, logical, character, integer, complex

    Same class      Different classes of elements
2D   Vector          List
3D  Matrix           Data frame

Data frame to matrix  : data.matrix()

factors: important for categorized data - gives levels for types of data

missing value : NaN, NA

Names possible for each type

With large amounts of data, it is better to specify the classes with colClasses = "numeric" for example, to run faster
If you don't know the classes or have columns with different classes, this is a quick dirty tip. 
Read in the different classes for a fixed number of rows, and ask R to find the type of columns. Then, use the classes to read in all the data

initial <- read.table("database.txt", nrows = 100)
classes <- sapply(initial, class)
taball <- read.table("database.txt", colClasses = classes)

apply, lapply[list apply], sapply[vector apply]

rep, mapply[matrix apply]

sweep - for data in different scales

aggregate(x, by, FUN, ..., simplify = TRUE)

dput x dget ... for individual objects
dump x source  ...for multiple objects

complete.cases: to remove missing values or rows with missing values NA from a vector/matrix...
